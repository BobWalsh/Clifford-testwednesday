<p>Back when books were [exclusively] made of paper, I would consume technical and business books by the backpack load, marking them up with yellow, green and other color highlights. If I really wanted to learn the book, I’d do a second pass, only reading the highlights and highlighting over the first color with another color.</p>

<p>For years I’ve searched for a simple way to gather my Kindle bookmarks and actually get some value out of them. I missed being able to do something with my highlights. Today, thanks to a chance online encounter with <a href="https://dev.to/theianjones/roam-research-to-explore-ideas-5cge/comments">Ian Jones</a> over on Dev.to, I learned about an awesome SaaS tool: <a href="https://readwise.io/i/bob67">Readwise</a>.</p>

<p>Readwise makes it easy to gather your Kindle bookmarks. And your bookmarks from Instapaper, iBooks, Pocket and the web. And through a simple hack, you can start actually getting the use out of all those expensive technical PDFs you’ve bought from developers and designers, like the excellent <a href="https://refactoringui.com/book/">Refactoring UI</a>.</p>

<p>So Readwise gathers all your highlights. Then what?</p>

<ul>
  <li>browse the highlights by book, or article,</li>
  <li>see a selection of highlights in a daily email,</li>
  <li>tag highlights so you can pull together material across source,</li>
  <li>share with friends/coworkers,</li>
  <li>browse, review and learn highlights with spaced repetition built in.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last feature is a <strong>gamechanger</strong>. Let’s say you’re trying to absorb how serverless functions work. You have bookmarks scattered all over the place: web pages and [highlights(https://help.getpocket.com/article/1144-highlighting-in-pocket)] in Pocket in Firefox or Chrome, Kindle books like <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/AWS-Lambda-Quick-Start-Guide-ebook/dp/B07F713C6G">this one</a>, pdfs that came in epub format as well or that you <a href="https://www.zamzar.com/">converted over</a>.</p>

<p>With Readwise, you can turn all those highlights into flashcards, and drill on them until you know the material. (<em>short rant: if you’re not spending 25% or more of your worktime learning new things, you’ll find yourself out of work in a year or two - been there, done that, it sucked.</em>)</p>

<p>There are other features in Readwise I’ll let you discover/explore <a href="https://readwise.io/i/bob67">during your free 30 day trial</a>, but really, Readwise had me sold the moment I saw my highlights from both Kindle and PDFs available together. A max of $8.99/month.</p>
