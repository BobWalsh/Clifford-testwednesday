<p>Since I’m starting <a href="https://freelancercashflow.com">FreelancerCashFlow</a>, I’m going to need a reliable email marketing service. I did my due diligence - checking out the list of usual suspects: Mailchimp, GetResponse, Drip, ConvertKit, SendInBlue, etc. etc.</p>

<p>My needs are simple: excellent deliverability, a generous free plan, support for RSS campaigns so I can use that for <a href="https://remoteorelse.com">Remote or Else</a>, and some semblance of support. Landing pages would be a plus too.</p>

<p>The problem with most services you’ll find reviews of is their customer support is terrible (“Check our forums!”), so reachable tech support mattered.</p>

<p>After spending way more time than I should have on this, I’ve settled on <a href="https://www.mailerlite.com/pricing">MailerLite</a>. MailerLite is not as well-known as say MailChimp, but they get the job done well.</p>

<p>You can read a good recent review of MailerLite in detail over on <a href="https://www.wpcrafter.com/review/mailerlite/">WPCrafter</a>.</p>

<p>Their pricing is up to 1,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails a month free, then up from their, but they undercut the other services if/when you get say 10k subscribers.</p>

<p>What has stood out during their free 15 day trial is that their tech support (accessable via an Intercom widget) was both knowledgeable and friendly. When you’re setting up a new service for your saas, you are going to need tech support at the beginning.</p>

<p>So, much like <a href="https://www.siteground.com/">SiteGround</a> for WP hosting, my recommendation goes MailerLite a the company that understands that reachable tech support is really necessary and a major product differentiator.</p>
