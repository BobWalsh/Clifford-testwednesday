As the deathcount rose and politicians dithered, it became just too painful to maintain.</h2>

<p>A month ago, my developer lifestyle of working from home and being self-employed made me an oddity. What a difference a month makes! Now, tens of millions of people work from home or you don‚Äôt work. Covid-19 has changed tens of millions of lives in the United States, as state after state have into effect some form of Shelter at Home.</p>

<p>Watching this disaster unfold, day after day, I wanted to do my bit to help. While I‚Äôve started a new chapter in my never-ending search to build a successful Saas, that‚Äôs my monkey on my back, not yet very interesting. But one thing that I can share are the lessons learned working remotely for over a decade.</p>

<p>So I‚Äôve launched <a href="https://remoteorelse.com">Remote or Else</a>, where each day I curate the best, most useful posts about working, learning, and living 24/7 at home, and twice a week, try to add a post of my own diving into one or another topics.</p>

<p>I fully realize everyone in the world has their own opinion and posts about WFH, the challenges of being fully remote, etc. etc. I hope to add my own useful two cents to the discussion through being very selective in what posts I curate (‚ÄúNews‚Äù), and what I write about. Also, I hope to write up in a shareable some of the templates from handling money to managing contracts to networking that others might find useful.</p>

<p>On my first try building this site, I went down the <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> rabbit hole, hoping that either Gatsby had matured or my React knowledge had improved. Nope. So, RemoteOrElse is a Gridsome project and outside of Gridsome‚Äôs unforgiving frontmatter parser, I fully recommend adding Gridsome to your developer skills.</p>

<p>Please stop by <a href="https://remoteorelse.com">Remote or Else</a>, tell me what you think, what you‚Äôd like to see more of, and what your interests are in this Brave New Work From Home World we‚Äôve now live in.</p>
