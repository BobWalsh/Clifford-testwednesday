<p>I‚Äôve been running my ‚Äúpersonal brand‚Äù blog at <a href="https://47hats.com">47hats</a> since 2005 on one platform or another; for the past decade in WordPress.</p>

<p>I <em>hate</em> WordPress.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm convinced that all that never-ending messing with plugins, theme configurations, broken wp installs and the like took all the joy out of blogging for the first generation of bloggers.</p>

<p>And performance <strong>sucked</strong>:</p>

<p>But the imperatives for blogging haven‚Äôt gone away: we still need a public way to connect to people, to show what we are (mostly) good at, to register as a ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù in whatever we are passionate about.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen a lot of various movements come and mostly go in the tech industry: Windows OS (don‚Äôt judge) at one time was revolutionary. Then, for me, there was Ruby on Rails. Then .js everything, React, Vue, and on and on. The difference between a tool (like webpack, gulp, etc.) and a movement is two things: people and affordances.</p>

<p>About a year ago after listening to <a href="https://syntax.fm/">Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski</a> raving about <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>, I decided to give it a try with a demo Jekyll example blog. I sat there gobsmacked for 10 minutes because I had never, ever, seen such an easy deploy resulting in such a performant site.</p>

<p>I started noticing how many interesting people were moving over to the JAMstack and how many startups were springing up in the space: this is a movement, not a shiny new object.</p>

<p>So last month I decided instead of hosting my WP site in WordPress on Siteground (the best of the WP hosts, IMO) for another year, I‚Äôd see if I could stand up my blog in Vue on Netlify.</p>

<p>I rapidly descended down several rabbit holes: first Nuxt, then VuePress, then Vuetify, then <a href="https://gridsome.org/">gridsome</a>. Gridsome is an awesome framework for someone who needs a home for their blog, with a few pages and wants to get it done <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p>Last night I threw the [dns] switch, and today my site looks like this:</p>

<p>My JAMstack journey is in its early days; HubSpot and Rails still pay the bills. But there are some amazing opportunities to create value that‚Äôs performant, fun to build and looks good everywhere: I hope to find my place in the JAMstack Revolution.</p>
