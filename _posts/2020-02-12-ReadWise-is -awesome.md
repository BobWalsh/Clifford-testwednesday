Back when books were [exclusively] made of paper, I would consume technical and business books by the backpack load, marking them up with yellow, green and other color highlights. If I really wanted to learn the book, I'd do a second pass, only reading the highlights and highlighting over the first color with another color.

For years I've searched for a simple way to gather my Kindle bookmarks and actually get some value out of them. I missed being able to do something with my highlights. Today, thanks to a chance online encounter with [Ian Jones](https://dev.to/theianjones/roam-research-to-explore-ideas-5cge/comments) over on Dev.to, I learned about an awesome SaaS tool: [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/bob67).

Readwise makes it easy to gather your Kindle bookmarks. And your bookmarks from Instapaper, iBooks, Pocket and the web. And through a simple hack, you can start actually getting the use out of all those expensive technical PDFs you've bought from developers and designers, like the excellent [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/).

So Readwise gathers all your highlights. Then what?

  * browse the highlights by book, or article,
  * see a selection of highlights in a daily email,
  * tag highlights so you can pull together material across source,
  * share with friends/coworkers,
  * browse, review and learn highlights with spaced repetition built in.

This last feature is a **gamechanger**. Let's say you're trying to absorb how serverless functions work. You have bookmarks scattered all over the place: web pages and [highlights(https://help.getpocket.com/article/1144-highlighting-in-pocket)] in Pocket in Firefox or Chrome, Kindle books like [this one](https://smile.amazon.com/AWS-Lambda-Quick-Start-Guide-ebook/dp/B07F713C6G), pdfs that came in epub format as well or that you [converted over](https://www.zamzar.com/).

With Readwise, you can turn all those highlights into flashcards, and drill on them until you know the material. (*short rant: if you're not spending 25% or more of your worktime learning new things, you'll find yourself out of work in a year or two - been there, done that, it sucked.*)

There are other features in Readwise I'll let you discover/explore [during your free 30 day trial](https://readwise.io/i/bob67), but really, Readwise had me sold the moment I saw my highlights from both Kindle and PDFs available together. A max of $8.99/month.
